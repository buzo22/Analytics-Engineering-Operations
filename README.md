# Analytics Engineering – Operations Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics engineering workflow that transforms raw operational data into analytics-ready datasets and trusted business metrics.

The focus of this project is on **data modeling, SQL transformations, and metric standardization**, rather than dashboard-only analytics.

---

## Tech Stack
- SQL
- Analytics Data Modeling (Fact & Dimension Tables)
- Power BI
- Cloud-ready architecture (Azure / Databricks compatible)

---

## Project Architecture

Raw Data  
→ Staging Layer (schema standardization, data typing)  
→ Analytics Layer (fact & dimension models)  
→ Metrics Layer (centralized KPI definitions)  
→ BI Consumption (Power BI)

---

## Business Use Case
Enable terminal operations teams to monitor productivity, asset performance, and operational efficiency using reliable and well-modeled analytics data.

---

## Key Metrics
- Total operational moves
- Total operations
- Average moves per operation
- Productivity by asset and terminal

---

## Why This Project
This project reflects real-world analytics engineering practices:
- Separation of transformation layers
- Centralized metric logic
- Analytics-ready data models
- BI-agnostic design
